Estimation of predator-prey mass ratios using stable isotopes: sources of errors.
=============

In PPMR_functions.R

1) Functions to estimate additive and scaled trophic position, and predator-prey mass ratios (PPMR). 

2) Function to simulate community of organisms across log2 body mass classes with corresponding nitrogen isotope values, and both additive and scaled TP estimates.
